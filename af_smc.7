.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Shared Memory Communication via RDMA
(SMC) is a socket over the RDMA
communication protocol that allows existing TCP socket applications
to transparently benefit from RDMA when exchanging data
over an
.I RDMA over Converged Ethernet
(RoCE) network. Those networks are not routable.
SMC provides
host-to-host direct memory access without traditional TCP/IP
processing overhead.
SMC offers preservation of existing IP topology and IP security, and
introduces minimal administrative and operational changes.
The exploitation of SMC is transparent to TCP socket applications.
.PP
The new address family
.B AF_SMC
supports the SMC protocol on Linux.
It keeps the address format of
.B AF_INET
and
.B AF_INET6
sockets and supports streaming socket types only.
.SS Usage modes
Two usage modes are possible:
.IP "AF_SMC native usage"
uses the socket domain
.B AF_SMC
instead of
.B AF_INET
and
.BR AF_INET6 .
Specify
.B SMCPROTO_SMC
for
.B AF_INET
compatible socket semantics, and
.B SMC_PROTO_SMC6
for
.B AF_INET6
respectively.
.IP "Usage of AF_INET socket applications with SMC preload library"
converts
.B AF_INET
and
.B AF_INET6
sockets to
.B AF_SMC
sockets.
The SMC preload library is part of the SMC tools package.
.PP
SMC socket capabilities are negotiated at connection setup. If
one peer is not SMC capable, further socket processing falls
back to TCP usage automatically.
.SS Implementation details: Links and Link Groups
To run RDMA traffic to a peer, a so-called
.I link
is established between
a local RoCE card and a remote RoCE card. To enhance availability, you can
configure alternate links with automatic fail over.
Primary and backup links to a certain peer are combined in a so-called
.I link
.IR group .
.SS RoCE adapter mapping: Creation of a pnet table
The SMC protocol requires grouping of multiple physical networks -
standard Ethernet and RoCE networks. Such groups are called
.I Physical Networks
(PNets). For SMC, RoCE adapter mapping is configured within a table called
.BR "pnet table" .
Any available Ethernet interface can be combined with available
.I RDMA-capable network interface cards
(RNICs),
if they belong to the same Converged Ethernet fabric.
To configure RoCE Adapter mapping, you must create a pnet table.
Modify the table with the smc-tools command
.IR smc_pnet .
.PP
For details see
.BR  smc_pnet (8).
.SS Displaying SMC socket state information
SMC socket state information can be obtained with the smc-tools command
.IR smcss .
For details see
.BR smcss (8).
.SS Starting a TCP application to work with SMC
To use an existing TCP application to work with SMC, use the SMC
preload library.
The SMC Tools package provides the command
.I smc_run
to convert
.B AF_INET
and
.B AF_INET6
socket calls to
.B AF_SMC
socket calls by means of the preload technique.
For more information about the preload mechanism, see also
.BR ld.so (8).
.PP
Example:
.IP
.B smc_run ftp
.PP
This command-line example starts an FTP client over SMC.
.PP
.SS MTU and Infiniband data transfer
Infiniband traffic may use MTU values 256, 512, 1024, 2048, or 4096.
SMC determines the configured MTU size of the RoCE Ethernet port,
announces this MTU size to the peer during connection start, and chooses
the minimum MTU size of both peers.
