SMC Tools (1.2.0)
===================

The SMC Tools provided in this package allow execution of existing TCP
applications over RoCE network without need to make changes in them.
In addition tools are provided to display SMC socket information.

This package consists of the tools:

- libsmc-preload.so : preload library.
- smc_run           : preload library environment setup script.
- smc_pnet          : C program for PNET Table handling
- smcss             : C program for displaying the information about active
                      SMC sockets.
- smc_rnics         : List available RDMA NICs

The preload shared library libsmc-preload.so provides mapping of TCP socket
operations to SMC sockets.
The environment setup script smc_run sets up the preload environment
for the libsmc-preload.so shared library before starting application.
The smcss program is used to gather and display information about the
SMC sockets.
The smc_pnet program is used to create, destroy, and change the SMC-R PNET
table.

In addition the package contains the AF_SMC manpage ("man af_smc").
